# Configuration

# Lsp Integration

Every time a new version is released, the json schema for the configuration file will be updated in the [github repo](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/sketch/tree/main/schemas). 

Each version will have its own distinct schema file, and the `latest.json` file will track the schema for the latest version.

You can then use this schema with the `yaml`, `toml` or `json` language servers to get autocompletion, type information and documentation for each element of the config file.
