# Typescript Projects

Sketch was initially conceived as a typescript-centric tool, as I needed a way to deal with the chaotic typescript ecosystem in a structured and easily reproducible way.

It supports a rich feature set dedicated to typescript, with dedicated [preset categories](../presets/typescript.md) (such as `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` presets) and [commands](../cli_docs.md#sketch-ts) (such as generating individual config files from presets, or generating barrel files).

These are the top level configuration settings for Typescript projects, with their default values:

```yaml
{{#include ../../../examples/typescript/typescript_settings.yaml:all}}
```
