# Typescript Projects

Sketch can be used to quickly generate Typescript monorepos and packages, and uses modular and extensible presets to define some reusable elements that can be shared among different kinds of typical TS projects.

These are the top level configuration settings for Typescript projects, with their default values:

```yaml
{{#include ../../../examples/typescript/typescript_settings.yaml}}
```
