# Package.json Presets

You can use the config file to store some `package.json` presets that you can easily reuse among different projects or packages with similar characteristics, like scripts or dependencies.

Just like [tsconfigs](./tsconfig_presets.md) and [global configurations](./configuration.md), `package.json` presets can also extend one another.
